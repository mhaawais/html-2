    <blockquote cite="chatgpt.com">
      <p>
        <em>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</em><br />
        And sorry I could not travel both<br />
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
        And looked down one as far as I could<br />
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br /><br />

        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
        Though as for that the passing there<br />
        Had worn them really about the same,<br /><br />

        And both that morning equally lay<br />
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
        I doubted if I should ever come back.<br /><br />

        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
        <b>Two roads diverged in a wood,</b> and I—<br />
        I took the one less traveled by,<br />
        And that has made all the difference.<br />

    <h3>2. <u>"Ode to a Nightingale"</u> – John Keats 🎶🌌</h3>
    <blockquote cite="chatgpt.com">
      <p>
        <em>My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains</em><br />
        My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,<br />
        Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains<br />
        One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:<br /><br />
        'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,<br />
        But being too happy in thine happiness,—<br />
        That thou, light-wingèd Dryad of the trees<br />
        In some <i>melodious plot</i><br />
        Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,<br />
        Singest of summer in full-throated ease.<br />
        <br />

    <h3>3. <u>"If—"</u> – Rudyard Kipling 💪🔥</h3>
    <blockquote cite="chatgpt.com">
      <p>
        <em>If you can keep your head when all about you</em><br />
        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />
        If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
        But make allowance for their doubting too;<br />
        If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
        Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br />
        Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br />
        And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too &nbsp; wise:<br /><br />

        If you can dream—and not make <i>dreams</i> your master;<br />
        If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br />
        If you can meet with &nbsp;&nbsp; Triumph and Disaster<br />
        And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />
        <i>If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken</i><br />
        Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
        Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
        <b>And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</b><br />
